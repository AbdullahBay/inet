Comparing DCTCP to TCP Reno in a Data Center Environment
========================================================

Goals
-----

DCTCP, described in RFC 8257 is a TCP congestion control mechanism tailored for
use in data centers. It relies on the use of Explicit Congestion Notification
(ECN) from the switches for detection of congestion. [...]

This showcase compares the behavior of DCTCP to TCP Reno using a traffic pattern
that is frequently found in data centers.
